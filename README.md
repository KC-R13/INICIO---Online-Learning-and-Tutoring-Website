# INICIO---Online-Learning-and-Tutoring-Website

Please refer through the index.php because you cannot access the landing page (home.php) without login in. 
It will redirect you to the login page if you try to access the home page and other pages (except register.php) without login in. I chose the "login in" as a way of authenticating and access controlling the users.
